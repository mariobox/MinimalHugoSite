# minimal

Source files of a barebones but functional Hugo site. See a Live Demo here: [http://mariobox.github.io/minimalhugodemo](http://mariobox.github.io/minimalhugodemo).

To use it as a starting point of a new blog, first [download Hugo](http://gohugo.io), install it and make sure it is in your PATH.

Then, clone this repository on your project folder and make the changes you want to the templates and/or content files.

To see your new site in action, type <code>hugo server -w</code> after the command prompt. This will launch a server in <localhost:1313> where you can see your site. If you make any changes to any of your files the server will refresh automatically.

Once you're satisfied with the way your site looks, kill the server with <code>Ctrl C</code> and run Hugo again, this time without the server option. Just type <hugo> and press enter.

Your site will be ready to publish in the /public folder.
